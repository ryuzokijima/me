# 🧬 Ryuzo Kijima — Building for Humanity

Hi, I'm Ryuzo.

Born in 2007. Raised between Singapore and Japan. Dropped out as a senior from a Japanese boarding school, and now building in San Francisco.

Since childhood, I've struggled with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In middle school, I began researching treatment methods. That led me to neuroscience research at the University of Tokyo's medical school. I soon realized: science alone wasn’t enough. I became obsessed with using technology to bring real change to people’s lives.

After internships at venture capital firms and AI labs, I built my first company in Japan — creating mental health robots for the elderly. But I faced a brutal truth: AI often fails not because it's weak, but because it doesn’t understand us.

This led to a deeper realization:  
> We don’t have the right data to teach AI about the human mind.

So now I’m working on something different.

## 🧠 What I'm building now

I’m building **Kokoro Research** — a long-term project to collect, structure, and analyze unstructured data from human inner lives.

- 🎤 I run deep interview projects (like documentaries) to record people's emotional histories.  
- 📱 I design consumer apps to passively collect data on daily emotions, decisions, and thoughts.  
- 🧠 I use these datasets to develop AI that can actually understand and support humans.

This is a decades-long vision.  
But I believe:  
> “Understanding the mind is the next frontier — for AI, for medicine, and for humanity.”

## 🧩 Side quests

While my core axis is **AI × human psychology**, I’ve always explored the edges of society and capital:

- 📈 Built a venture capital program to support Japanese student founders
- 🧳 Ran a contract dev agency to understand the game of capitalism firsthand
- 🧠 Designed and tested dozens of mini-projects, from caregiving to consumer AI tools

I believe side projects are soul projects. They teach faster than any school.
